<h1>Landscape Gardening Website</h1>
  <br/>
 <h2>Application Overview</h2> 
   <p>Having recently finshed my education with EdX on the Front-End Web Application Development course, I want to continue regular coding and expanding my knowledge with Javascript, CSS and React. A member of my family needs a website built for their Landscape Gardening business. I aim to create a visually pleasing site which showcases the business in a gallery and also has a contact page.</p>
